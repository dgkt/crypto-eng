This program gets your password from the /etc/shadow like password = fopen(/etc/shadow, "r");
Initialize variable int ok = 0;
Then a buffer is declared to store the passphrase in like char buffer[100];
Then the program reads the the entered passphrase by using scanf(%s, buffer);
Then the hash of passphrase and password is calculated and compared to eachother:
if(H(password) == H(passphrase))
	ok = 1;
Then the program does something like:
if(ok)
	printf("You're root");
exit(0);
