The difference between /dev/random and /dev/urandom is on how they pull random data from the kernel. /dev/random always pull data from the entropy pool, if the pool is empty, /dev/random will block the operation until the pool will be filled again. /dev/urandom will generate data using SHA (also any othe algorithm, and sometimes also using MD5) algorithm when the entropy pool is empty, so it won't block the operation. So /dev/urandom is strong enough to provide random data, which /dev/random usually needs longer time to provide it, because it needs to stop the operation while waiting the entropy to be filled again.
