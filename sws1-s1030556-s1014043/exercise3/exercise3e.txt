The C program will output every initialized 16-bit random number to the terminal. 
Everytime something is printed to the terminal, a line counter is incremented in the program.
The file exercise3d.txt has been made, that is opened with: FILE *output_file = fopen("exercise3d.txt", "a");
The "a" parameter of fopen allows for the file to be read from and written to by the program.
Eventually the program will terminate, because the value is 42, at that point the program also writes the line counter to the text file.
