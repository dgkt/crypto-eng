5b Strings are meant to be immutable types, because in C strings are character arrays (which are static). You are not allowed to set the variable value directly, because that would change something the address of a static type into the starting address of what you want to put in the variable. Strcpy will copy values into an already allocated piece of memory and therefore, you don't change the address.
5c The last byte is reserved for the null-terminator. If the null-terminator is omitted, then functions like printf will keep reading strings until they hit the next null terminator (possibly of a string value that is adjacent in memory).
